## About the Title

- Sounds a bit strange?
- Clickbait?
___

**Actually... generated by an AI!**

**What actually I want to share?**
I will share my experience of learning and experimenting with Python and Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D printing projects.

## Why Python?

![bg right:40% 80%](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)

- Easy to learn and use
- Widely adopted in AI and LLM research
- "The Swiss Army knife of programming languages"

---

## Why LLMs for 3D Printing?

- Addressing the "skill issue" in 3D modeling
- Exploring new possibilities in design

---

## How To solve that?

1. Using Existing Models
   - Example: OpenAI's Shape-E

2. Generating OpenSCAD Code
   - LLMs writing 3D modeling scripts

---

## Approach 1: Using Existing Models

- Text-to-3D generation
- Ideal for organic shapes
- Quick prototyping
- Have lot of limitations (for now)

---

## Approach 2: Generating OpenSCAD Code

```openscad
cylinder(h = 10, r1 = 5, r2 = 3);
translate([0, 0, 10])
sphere(r = 3);
```
___

## Demo and challenges

- Demo: Generating a 3D model using OpenAI's Shape-E
- Challenges: 
  - Lack of control over the model
  - Model still in erly stages
- Demo: Generating OpenSCAD code using LLMs
- Challenges:
  - Generate complex models

---

## Conclusion And Feasibility
- Still in early stages
- Requires a lot of experimentation and learning
- Can using RAG for better results (future work)
- Can try fine-tuning for better results (future work)
